# Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal
                    
This portal provides an online public resource of the Blue Brain Project's first release of a digitalreconstruction of the microcircuitry of juvenile Rat somatosensory cortex, access to experimental data sets used in the reconstruction, and the resulting models.


This repo contains the main files modified to push to the [BBP Object Storage](https://bbpopenstack.epfl.ch/dashboard/project/containers/container/nmc-portal-static/nmc-portal)

To re-generate some files in a bulk way a notebook (fetch-info-notebook.ipynb) is available

To push to object storage a script file (test-s3-locally.py) is available. You would need to add the credentials

## Funding and Aknowledgement
